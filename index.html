      <h2>my story</h2>
      <p id="content__my-story">If you know me you already know that I love to learn and study. If you don't, my name is Malvina Hasa (she/her), and this is my personal resume website. I am lucky enough to be living in New York, however I was born and raised in the beautiful Albania. I have graduated from two business and economic universities thus far, one back home, and the other one in New York. Right after graduating I immediately took a 200-hour yoga training course (because I need to learn something… constantly). I was randomly selected to come to the United States and from that moment my life plans changed, although my goals stayed the same. That event gave me not only the excitement of having the opportunities to make my dreams as a little girl from a small country come true, but also dream bigger.  I have been enjoying a few passions so far such as painting, yoga, play dryms, tufting, and more. I have recently discovered an interest in coding as a skill to further expres and develop my creativity, and that is my new excitement. My main focus is in learning and further developing front end techniques and skills such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JAVASCRIPT, responsive design, Git, debugging and other.</p>

      <h2>my work</h2>
      <p id="content__portfolio">Web development is not only just a new passion for me. My goal is to develop a career in software engineering so that I can combine it in the future with my passion for designing, my love for math and science, my dedication on studying business and business for health professions, and the desire to bring about change in the world. In doing so I would be one step closer to creating and defining a product that can positively change and/or affect the life of a large community.</p>
